# I create a various components for different different purpose-
# I use Tailwind CSS for Styling

1. Navbar - It shows the navbar with logo and one 'Get Users' button. After I click the button get some cards with users details.
2. Home - Our home component shows some text with instruction to click that 'Get Users' button.
3. Cards - Basically I used react bootstrap for create card. receive details as a props and I used this for render each user details in card.
4. ShowCards - Using 'Hooks' I created a State and useEffect(for fetching API) then, I render details using map and show cards conditionally rendering with loader.
5. Loader - In loader component I used Material UI Icon for loading.
